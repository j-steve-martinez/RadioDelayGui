## Why

![Gary and Verne](resources/verne_gary.jpg?raw=true)

National broadcast announcers are not as interesting to listen to when you are watching your team play. Thus, it is nice to listen to your local radio broadcast when you are watching the TV broadcast. However, radio broadcasts are often 10-30 seconds ahead of the TV broadcast and ruin the experience of watching the game. You cannot make your play the game sooner with your DVR, so you must make the radio play later. This tool allows you to do that.

## Why not just get the radio broadcast online?

Online radio often does not allow you to pause. Tools could be written to capture these streams, but this would rely on the radio stations not changing their online player. There are probably some things that could be done to capture the aduio output of the online player, however, I just found this to be the simplest way to tackle the problem. It is simple enough, and reliable enough, for my purposes and is straight forward enough for both me to use and people who are only mildly tech literate.
